    SASL authentication is enabled by default. Certain Jabber server don't seem to work well with Smack
    (the XMPP library used by this plugin). 
    <p>
    So, if your connection doesn't work and you see an error in the logs that reads:
    <tt>WARNING: SASL authentication failed using mechanism PLAIN</tt> - or similar -
    you should disable SASL authentication.
    </p>
